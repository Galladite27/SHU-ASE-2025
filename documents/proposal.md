# Planning and documentation requirements
From assessment specification:
* Plan and manage the project using appropriate software engineering methods
* Document requirements using suitable techniques (user stories, use case models, _or_ requirements specifications)

Relevant deliverables:
* 4 user stories, use case diagrams
* C4 (?) model diagrams, interface designs, data design diagrams
* Implementation notes (technology stack, setup instructions, repository link)
* Testing documentation
* Group work diary using provided template

From presentation:
* We need a team leader and a scrum master
* We need multiple sprints of 1-4 weeks (but likely 2-3) with sprint planning, sprint, then sprint retrospective
* We need _daily_ scrums

Relevant deliverables:
* Backlog
* Sprint backlogs
* Increments

All of this information is quite scattered, and so the "grading criteria" section of the assessment brief will be the main standard. Also, from the looks of things we can remove that horrible "about us" HTML document. No idea why he told us we had to have one in a previous lesson, only for it not to be mentioned anywhere in the assessment.

# My proposal
* Haris is team leader
* I am scrum master and manage planning and documentation both overall and for scrums & sprints
* I will begin a document containing everything which needs recording, and take the task of updating it each week
* We will aim today to finalise a set of user stories and use case diagrams and begin working on wireframes, check what the unknown models and diagrams are, and if they are required, then for tomorrow research what those other diagrams are
* I will immediately record the implementation notes as they are at this stage, and review them at the end
* Consulting you about the plan, I will write an outline of the system, and from that create and confirm with you an initial backlog
* We will begin our first sprint next week, with me setting up a proposal for our sprint planning to get it done quickly and get us working
* I will manage the master branch of the Github repository, as well as tagging and releasing the "increments"
* Concerning scrums, I will write a template for a thread to be created each morning in the Discord server for people to fill in (1 min only per day), with opportunity for discussion or to wait until we meet in-person
* Finally, concerning meeting, I would like us to meet in-person for the two-hour gap on a tuesday to have sprint (or if in the middle of a sprint, general) meetings where we aren't interrupted by the teacher and his tasks
