# Info
Rather than over-complicate things with Jira or Trello, we have decided that the scope of the project and the number of things to do only warrants a simple way of tracking our backlog. Also, this file can be included in the published releases, produced as evidence at the end of each sprint period.

# Todo
* Do research into an AI feature we can add but don't actually implement it

* Video presentation (Haris completed slides ready record 7 minute video, please add your names as you have completed it here - when everyone has done I will move it to Done)
