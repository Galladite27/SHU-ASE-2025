**SHU ASE Group 12 2025**

# Introduction (2-3 minutes)
## Team member introductions
Haris: "Hello, my name is Haris and I was the Product Owner for our SustainWear project. My main responsibility was managing the backlog, prioritising features, and ensuring that what we built aligned with the project requirements and user needs."
Laurie: "Good morning, I'm Laurie and in this project I worked mainly on documentation and frontend."
Alex: "Hello, I'm Alex and I primarily worked on the front end of the system. I also created the user stories, wireframe and some of the LSEPI report."
Theo: "Hi, I’m Theo. I mainly worked on the backend and the Database."

## Product goal
Theo: "Our product goal was to enable donors and charities to co-operate with sharing clothes and tracking carbon savings through a secure and performant web application."

# Project planning and management (5 minutes)
## Project organisation
Laurie: "Our project management was primarily focussed on the agile method, with sprints typically lasting one or two weeks. We maintained a backlog, selecting certain tasks for each sprint and then reviewing how we had got on as a team each week."
Haris: "Throughout the project I maintained our backlog, which includes tasks across design, development, testing, and future improvements. As Product Owner, I tracked what was in our 'To Do', what was being worked on, and what we had completed each sprint. This helped the team stay organised and made sure we always had clarity on what the next priorities were. I also made key decisions such as prioritising tasks."
Laurie: "We didn't realise until we were quite far through the project that sprints were all supposed to be the same length, however using sprints of varied length ended up being quite useful so that we could focus on small or large projects without having nothing to do or having tasks frequently spill over into the next sprint."
Laurie: "However, progress tracking was limited to our weekly meetings and so more frequent reviews could have led to certain tasks being completed before the end of their sprints by having more people start helping sooner."

## Formative feedback
Laurie: "We attended the sessions, and as seen in this image received and acted on formative feedback. Not all the feedback we received is recorded here, however this is enough to provide evidence that we did take on feedback."

# Requirements and design (7-8 minutes)
## Diagrams
Laurie: "We made use of various techniques and diagrams to gather and formalise requirements. For example, you can see here our use case diagram (made by Haris), entity relationship diagram (initially made by Ryan and then altered and finalised by Theo)), and a sequence diagram (made by Laurie)."
Laurie: "I also produced C4 diagrams to provide an overview of how everything would fit together in different levels of detail. You can see here context, container and component diagrams for our project."

## Technology stack
Laurie: "As for architectural models, our project loosely adhered to the MVC model, since NextJS which we used lends itself towards this approach. We had a model (the database), a view (the frontend), and a controller (the web server and API routes)."
Laurie: "And our data was stored in a structured database, namely SQLite, for ease of use with such a small-scale project."

## Early development
Haris: "Early on in the project, I took a lead by building the landing page and initial dummy dashboards and setting up Clerk authentication, then later setting role-based page routing, restricting pages based on user type, creating the sign-up flow, and completing the admin, donor, and charity sidebar protection. This one-person job meant that other team members could then start working on different pages."
Alex: "During the initial requirements-gathering stage, I worked on creating the user stories and the wireframe for both a mobile and web design. I believe creating the user stories helped both myself and the other group members to get a better idea of the scope of the project. I also believe that creating the wireframe helped get the ball rolling with the design of the pages as we could better see how our end design might look. It also meant that we were no longer simply starting with a blank page which I believe was a contributing factor to the ease in which we managed to develop our pages."
Laurie: "Early on, I reviewed Alex's user stories and made some changes for clarity, but mostly during the early stages I helped co-ordinate documents and collaboration - I created the Github repository and Discord server, made the blank project with our chosen NPM packages and settings, and created and started recording everything we did in the master document. Throughout the project, besides the documentation and diagrams I did, I mainly helped with frontend portions of the site, co-creating the charts and the donor analytics page, and also reviewing and fixing visual bugs and consistency issues."
Theo: "I took on the role of designing the database after Ryan created the first ER diagram. It was decided to use SQLite for storing the data as it easier to use for the smaller scale of this project. It also meant that the database was easily shared among the group as the data was stored in a db file that could be uploaded to github rather than all of us having to maintain our own MySQL server. This also made it easier to use within an AGILE setting as during the rest after a sprint I could easily change how the database operated and update the ER diagram so that for the next sprint everyone was on the same page on how it operated."
Theo: "I originally envisioned that the user would be able to donate multiple items in the same donation. This did not work out but the database was designed in a way that it would still work with a single item being donated at a time. I also planned for the database to store the password and more information for the user. This was changed as Clerk was implemented which stored these values. All I did was get rid of these inside the database and replace it with the Clerk Id instead."

# Prototype demonstration (6-7 minutes)
Haris is presenting, right?
Alex: "All of our users have been tested so that they can perform their respective tasks. For example, with the donor, they have the ability to log into the system and then make a donation of their chosen item using the form provided under the "new donation" page. This form makes it very simple for the user to make a donation as it contains placeholder texts and required field markers, therefore, users understand beforehand which information they are expected to enter about their item. They are also expected to attach a photo of their item at the bottom of the page. This is also clearly laid out for them. Once the donor has made a donation, they will be able to see their updated Co2 savings under their dashboard. Both of these are entirely according to the initial user stories that I created for the donor. Donor analytics were implemented by Laurie and I, and linked to the database by Theo."
Alex: "As for the charity user, these features were implemented by Theo. According to the user stories, the user should be able to keep track monitor oncoming donations. This is necessary so that they can keep track of the number of donations that they are receiving as a store. They should also be able to view the number of pending donations and total items in stock currently at their store so that they can efficiently manage their store's stock levels. As per our system, the charity user can monitor the incoming donations using a very useful incoming donations page which allows the user to either accept or decline the incoming donations. As per the feedback from the lecturer, we have now also implemented a confirmation pop-up box so that if the user selects to either accept or decline a donation , they are asked to confirm that they wish to complete this action. This will prevent any unwanted deletions or acceptances. Furthermore, on the incoming donations page, alongside the accept and decline buttons a multitude of information is displayed to the user, about each item. They can then compare these details against the inventory page which can be found via the sidebar under "Inventory", this will help them to decide whether or not they need any more of those items at their branch. This will influence their decision as to whether they should accept or decline the item."
Alex: "Finally, for the admin user which was implemented largely by Haris with refactoring and polishing by Laurie. According to the user stories, the admin user should be able to oversee the system meaning they can add and remove user accounts when needed. They should also be able to generate analytic reports and be able to view a weekly breakdown of the donations each day. The admin dashboard also contains a breakdown of the total users, total charities, the total number of donors within the system and the total number of new users on that specific day. It also contains a list of recent donations made by users alongside some brief information about the item including the branch it was donated to and donation status. Furthermore, for the admin impact report page, the admin user can see the total donations this week displayed directly alongside the total Co2 saved. They also have a graph displaying the donations per-day and another displaying the Co2 savings per-day. Each of these graphs contains enough days for one week, allowing the admin to easily visualise the impact their store is having. It also allows them to identify any weak spots within the week, potentially some days that they are consistently not receiving many donation they could potentially feed this information back to people higher up"
Alex: "Overall, for each of the users we have gone beyond the initial requirements that we gathered from the user. Not only have we gone above and beyond here but we have ensured that they system remains easy-to-use and practical throughout all of the different users. One way In which we have ensured they system has remained easy to use is as we haven't overcomplicated the user experience by covering the pages with unnecessary text, we have only included messages for the user where completely necessary and where we think they add value to the user experience. One example of this is on the donor's dashboard and impact page, we have included a variety of friendly messages which encourage users to donate and therefore encourage them to help the environment."

# Testing (3-4 minutes)
Laurie: "We didn't consider testing throughout using a shift-left approach, and so all our testing (besides continuous basic testing as features were added) was carried out near the end of the project."
Laurie: "We didn't implement unit tests, however we carried out acceptance tests (to do with the user stories), as well as some usability and security tests."
Haris: "I did make sure the database was in line with the ERD."
Alex: "Personally, I conducted tests of the system against the user stories. Given that we didn't have too many user stories it was quite straight forward and I was very happy to see that we had met the user's requirements for the final system that we had built."

# Reflections on LSEPI (2-3 minutes)
Haris: "One of the biggest ethical issues relates to our sustainability feature, where users can see their personal CO₂ savings from donating clothes. This is designed to motivate users, but it also creates a responsibility for us to ensure that the information we display is accurate. If the CO₂ data is incorrect or exaggerated, this could lead to accusations of greenwashing. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, greenwashing is when an organisation makes people believe they are doing more for the environment than they really are. And as highlighted by Ireland (2023), the consequences can be serious: loss of trust, legal action, and increased scrutiny. For this reason, we had to treat sustainability data carefully and avoid misleading users."
Laurie: "From a professional perspective, we also had to consider system reliability. If the website is slow or experiences downtime, donors may simply give up and throw items away instead. Google reports that 53% of users abandon a mobile website if it takes more than three seconds to load. This emphasises the need for fast performance and good technical practices, especially for a system that relies on user engagement to support charitable donations."
Alex: "There were also significant social and accessibility considerations. Our system needs to work for a wide range of users, including elderly donors, disabled users, and people with low technical confidence. Because SustainWear is web-based, we were able to integrate accessibility features such as alternative text for images and compatibility with screen readers. However, some aspects — like increasing text size — depend on the user’s own device settings. In future, SustainWear could also support physical donation points to make the system more inclusive for non-technical users."
Alex: "A major legal and ethical concern was the secure handling of user data, especially because our platform manages personal information such as names, emails and login credentials. To comply with GDPR, we chose to use Clerk as our authentication provider. Clerk uses strong encryption practices such as bcrypt with unique per-password salts, and TLS for secure data transmission. This aligns with the ICO’s requirement for organisations to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect user data."
Haris: "We also implemented secure role-based routing using Clerk middleware. This prevents users from accessing dashboards they are not authorised for, such as a donor trying to access admin pages by typing a URL manually. This protects both privacy and system integrity. While any third-party authentication service carries some risk — for example, Okta experienced a data breach in 2023 — Clerk still provides security measures that would be very difficult for a small student team to implement to the same standard."
Theo: "Finally, there are social and usability implications linked to routing and clarity of navigation. The UK Government Digital Service emphasises the importance of a clear, simple journey for users with lower digital literacy. Our dashboard routing contributes to this by ensuring users land on the correct section automatically without confusion."
Laurie: "Overall, LSEPI considerations shaped many of our decisions throughout the project — from how we generated sustainability data, to how we secured user accounts, to how we designed the experience for diverse users. This helped us ensure our prototype was not only functional, but also responsible, accessible and professionally designed."

# Group reflection and collaboration (2-3 minutes)
Haris: "Overall, we worked quite well as a team although unfortunately one member didn't turn up very often and didn't want to participate in the presentation, saying he wasn't planning on coming back after Christmas."
Laurie: "My thoughts on the agile method is that it was quite useful for our team, and I'm sure that it was the better choice for our purposes than a traditional method, due to our small team, unusual timetable, need for continuous updates to give to tutors and lack of knowledge about how things would go. However, ironically I found that the agile method was (seemingly artificially) restrictive in some ways, such as how sprints were supposed to be the same length when this just didn't fit our project."
Laurie: "The main challenges we faced in this project were to do with communication, but it never got very bad because we ensured we had frequent (often at least weekly) in-person meetings and maintained online correspondence."
Alex: "One of the collaboration challenges that I personally faced which I feel affected the group was the difficulty of managing the GitHub branches. I found it difficult to keep track of who was working on which branch and therefore which branch I needed to branch from whilst I was doing certain tasks. Aside from this, GitHub worked really well for our team on the whole and I feel as if I learned a lot about how to use and manage it correctly from other group members such as Laurie."
Theo: "A challenge I faced during this was with the database as Ryan had originally designed the ERD diagram which would shape the database and backend for the project and then I looked and edited some parts normalising it and some parts replacing but didn’t completely redo. This is because I didn’t want to take over and undo everything that he did. This led to a Frankenstein of a database as it was two peoples vision of the database which in my opinion made it harder to use. I should of communicated and worked with Ryan to create a better solution."
Theo: "Also if we had more time we would of implemented an AI to help recognise the what piece of clothing was uploaded by the user. This could increase the donation speed and allow for greater CO2 savings. This could be done by using clarfai apparel classification ai, this recognises the clothes worn by the user and decides what category it should fit into. The drawback to this API is that it works best when the clothes are worn by the user and not layering down or on a coat hanger."
Theo: "Another AI categoriser that I think could have been beneficial to this project is velebit ai fabric pattern recognition this checks the pattern on clothing this could be stored and shown to the charity staff so that they could have more information on the clothes being donated before having to check the image."
Theo: "but even if we did use ai to help categorise it should be the priority to allow the user to change this as AI is not always perfect and the user would know more about the item."
