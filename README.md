# SHU Applied Software Engineering group project
## Required Github practices
Branches:
* `master` - approved, working code (merge into master on stable versions)
* `dev` - integration branch for feature branches to be merged into
* feature branches - short-lived for making single additions and improvements

Files:
* `README.md` - containing usage information, MUST have overview section, anything else as appropriate
* `about-us.html` - must exist and contain bio for each team member in format specified in week 2.2 instructions

PR review:
* Clear, related changes (ideally one feature per merge)
* Descriptive commit messages
* Builds/runs without errors if merged into master
* At least 1 review from other team member

Specifically what will be checked for by tutor:
* README.md with Overview section
* about-us.html with all team members added
* Git history shows use of feature branches
* Pull requests made into development, then finally merged into master
