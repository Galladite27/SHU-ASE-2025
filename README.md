Group number: 12

To add here:
* Introducing the master document as what ties together the documentation of our work
* Instructions on using the software (website)

## Required Github practices (for our reference)
Branches:
* `master` - approved, working code (merge into master on stable versions)
* `dev` - integration branch for feature branches to be merged into
* feature branches - short-lived for making single additions and improvements

Files:
* `README.md` - containing usage information, overview section, anything else as appropriate

PR review:
* Clear, related changes (ideally one feature per merge)
* Descriptive commit messages
* Builds/runs without errors if merged into master
* At least 1 review from other team member

Specifically what will be checked for by tutor:
* README.md with Overview section
* about-us.html with all team members added
* Git history shows use of feature branches
* Pull requests made into development, then finally merged into master
